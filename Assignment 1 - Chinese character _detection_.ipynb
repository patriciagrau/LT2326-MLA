    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical character recognition is an old \"AI\" and image-processing task.  What it involves is taking a photograph or scan of a piece of text (printed or handwritten) and turning the characters (as images) into character codes on the computer that therefore allow the text to be edited, indexed, etc.  A key part of that process is identifying where the characters actually are, especially if the characters are mixed among other non-writing, such as images of objects or people.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will **take images from a Chinese image database with annotations that indicate where the Chinese characters are, and you will train a model that takes test images, and superimposes upon them a visualization (of your choosing, e.g., a \"heat map\") of the likelihood that a pixel is close to or part of a valid Chinese character**.  The image database contains annotations of \"bounding boxes\", coordinates of the corners of a box that contains a single Chinese character.  In a sense, this assignment asks you to detect the bounding boxes in test images without the annotation, but a softer version of this: simply to **provide the probability, for each pixel, whether that pixel was part of a bounding box containing a Chinese character**.  Then, you are to \n",
    "   1. **superimpose upon the image a pixel-based map of likelihoods of where the bounding boxes ought to be** and\n",
    "   2. **apply an evaluation statistic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment grants you a lot of freedom in how you organize your code and set up the task overall.  Because of the degree of freedom it involves, it will mostly be graded on our evaluation of the effort put into the solution.  An actual high success at the task is not a requirement to get a high grade.  However, you will have to **report in detail**, in your own format, what you did, why you did it, how to run it -- it must run on mltgpu, be implemented in Python using PyTorch, and make use of the GPUs -- and how to apply it easily to our own test images.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have almost a month to do this assignment, even though it is worth only 30% of your grade.  Another assignment with 30% will be given out for the last/remaining two weeks of the study period.   These time periods are coextensive with that of the project, but we expect you to be able to schedule your time well enough to put in an effort at both. This assignment is officially due at 23:59 on 2021 October 18. There are 30 points on this assignment, and a maximum of 20 bonus points."

The metadata is in json format.  info.json contains information about every image file.  We will unzip only a minority of the original training image files.  train.jsonl is a list of json entities, one per line (that have to be parsed with the json package each separately) that correspond to the files in info.json.
